# AI-StudyCoach: A Personal AI Tutor for Students

Final project for the **Building AI** course  

## Summary  
AI-StudyCoach is an intelligent learning assistant that helps students prepare for national exams in math and science.  
It adapts exercises to each student’s level, explains mistakes step by step, and gives motivational feedback in real time.  

## Background  
Many students struggle to know *how* to study effectively.  
Teachers often don’t have enough time to provide personal feedback, and parents may lack the subject knowledge to help.  
This is a common problem in all schools — especially for students who lack motivation or confidence.  

As a former teacher with over 15 years of experience, I’ve seen how much difference individual support can make.  
The goal of AI-StudyCoach is to provide that kind of personalized help for every student, anytime, anywhere.  

## How is it used?  
Students log in through a web app or mobile app.  
AI-StudyCoach analyses their previous results, asks what topics they want to improve, and generates tailored practice questions.  
After each answer, the AI explains the reasoning and adjusts the difficulty for the next task.  
It can be used both at home and in the classroom.  

## Data sources and AI methods  
- Training data comes from open educational resources such as past national exams and official curriculum data.  
- The AI model uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to understand students’ written answers and **Machine Learning** to personalize the exercises.  
- A **recommendation system**, similar to Netflix’s, suggests the next best topic for each student.  

## Challenges  
- Ensuring that explanations are pedagogically sound and factually correct.  
- Handling privacy and data protection issues, since the users are minors.  
- Preventing the system from being misused as a shortcut or cheating tool instead of genuine learning support.  

## What next?  
The next step is to collaborate with schools and teachers to test the system in real conditions.  
With feedback and additional data, AI-StudyCoach could grow into a national-level learning platform for students and educators.
